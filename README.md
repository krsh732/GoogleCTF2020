# Google CTF 2020

I had no clue Google CTF 2020 was going on during Aug 22 to Aug 24, and so I could not participate while the event was live :frowning:. However, I decided to try some of the challenges with breadsticks for fun later on. Below are solutions to some of the challenges I managed to complete thus far. 

**Warning:** Some of them may be missing writeups or have incomplete writeups. Furthermore, due to my lack of experience with both writing and ctf-ing, some or all of the content I have produced (code, images, writeups, etc.) may damage your eyes, brain and/or soul. I take no responsibility.
