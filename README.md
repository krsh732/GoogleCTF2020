# Google CTF 2020

I had no clue [Google CTF 2020](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/) was going on during Aug 22 to Aug 24, and so I could not participate while the event was live :frowning:. However, I decided to try some of the challenges with breadsticks for fun later on. Below are solutions to some of the challenges I managed to complete thus far.

**Note:** the solve script for a challenge can be found at: `./category/challenge/solve.py`

**Warning:** Some of them may be missing writeups or have incomplete writeups. Furthermore, due to my lack of experience with both writing and ctf-ing, some or all of the content I have produced (code, images, writeups, etc.) may damage your eyes, brain and/or soul. I take no responsibility.
